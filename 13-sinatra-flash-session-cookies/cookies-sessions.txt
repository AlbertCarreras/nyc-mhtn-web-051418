gotchas — you need two gems: `sinatra-contrib` for cookies and `sinatra-flash` for flash

we need to do the following in our configure block in `ApplicationController.rb`:
```helpers Sinatra::Cookies # this is the sinatra cookies module
    register Sinatra::Flash  # this is for flash```
more on what `helpers` and `register` do here: http://sinatrarb.com/extensions.html
I also have three helper modules now — one for cookies, one for sessions, one for flash — those depend on the `require_all 'app/helpers'` in `ApplicationController` and the `helpers CookieHelpers, SessionHelpers, FlashHelpers` call in the configure block
The functionality: 
1. We store a cookie (still potatopancakes) with a boolean in it that says whether we’ve seen the user before — so we greet users who show up with no potatopancakes cookie, and we welcome back users who HAVE the cookie
2. We can favorite books, and their IDs are stored in the session. As we iterate, we show whether the book has been favorited or a form to favorite it (POST to `/books/:id/favorites`)
3. We set a key in the flash to the title of the book on `/books/:id/favorites`, and then check that same key on `/books`. Values in flash automatically disappear after 1 request, so it will only show up on the subsequent (redirected) request to `/books`. If we have a title in the flash, we’ll show a message saying we just favorited that title.
