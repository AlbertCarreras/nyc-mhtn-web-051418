JSX & Props
===========

## SWBAT

- [-] Use historical context and the Mod 3 experience to explain why React and declarative programming is special
- [x] Setup a new React app and play around with building things
- [x] See what a React Component actually is (an object, made by a class)

- [-] Build custom components and see initial JSX
- [ ] Build modular & reusable components
- [ ] See how props are to components as arguments are to functions

## Outline

### React.Component

- class syntax
- render()
- JSX

### Modular Components

- import / export
- declarative programming

### Props

- what are they?
