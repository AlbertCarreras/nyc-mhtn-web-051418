Intro to React
==============

## SWBAT

- [x] Use historical context and the Mod 3 experience to explain why React and declarative programming is special
- [x] Setup a new React app and play around with building things
- [x] Build custom components and see initial JSX
- [x] See what a React Component actually is (an object, made by a class)
- [ ] Build modular & reusable components
- [ ] See how props are to components as arguments are to functions

- [ ] Learn how to identify components on a page, visually
- [ ] Understand how create-react-app works and what it offers a developer
- [ ] Get more familiarity with component hierarchy and the flow of information

## Outline

### Vanilla JS

- Pros/Cons?

Big blocks of `HTML`
Closures - interesting but tough
debugger
really hard to save API keys in the frontend
this this this really a lot of this
disorganized
lots of globals
break it down into a million functions => components

### History / Context of React

`npm install -g create-react-app`

- react vs react-dom

### Project Setup

- create-react-app
- anatomy of a create-react-app

(tinder for recipes)

### JSX

- it's just syntactic sugar for React.createElement
- rules, differences with HTML
- HTML vs Components
- expressions

### React.Component

- class syntax
- render()
- JSX

### Modular Components

- import / export
- declarative programming

### Props

- what are they?
- how do we use them?
